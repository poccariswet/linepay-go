# linepay-go

This repository is library for linepay sandbox.

## Configuration

You need to prepare ENV, like this.

```sh
PAY_CHANNEL_ID=""
PAY_CHANNEL_SECRET_KEY=""
PAY_HOSTNAME=""
PAY_LINE_USERID=""
```

## Prepare

I recommend using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), so you should download before you try to linepay.
